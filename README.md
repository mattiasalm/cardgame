# Simple card game

Ability to draw cards, sort and shuffle the cards. More decks can be added to the pile of cards and reset to only one deck.

Sorting is done by ordering the cards by their color and suit. Colors are sorted in the order of `clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades`. And the suits is ordered in ascending order and `ace` is considered the highest value.

Shuffle uses a modern version of the [Fischer-Yates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle#The_modern_algorithm) algoritm. Uses modern ES6 features for fast shuffling and compact code.

## Style

Inspiration has been taken from **Wes Anderson's** style in his recent movies where he is a big fan of using Futura as the font and is keen of using yellow and red tones.

For the images on the higher suits, jack, queen and king, alternative movie posters has been used.
